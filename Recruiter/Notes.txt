About Me :-
    I consider myself to be a "learner for life." I am constantly looking for opportunities to gain more knowledge regarding anything that comes my way. In a field that requires maximum use of the left brain for logical thinking, I try to do things the creative way. An opportunity that will help me enhance my skills and add new ones to my list is what I'm looking for.

    1) Android Studio : Tic Tac Toe
    2) Unit Converter
    3) Leisure ActiviTEAs
    4) Portfolio website
